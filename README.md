Data Preprocessing
Annotation Parsing: Parses XML annotations to retrieve bounding box coordinates.
Normalization: Bounding box coordinates are normalized to improve training stability.
Data Augmentation: Applied with ImageDataGenerator for horizontal flips, brightness, and contrast adjustments.
Model Architecture
EfficientNet: Pre-trained EfficientNetB0 as the feature extraction backbone.
Head: Two dense layers with dropout for regularization, followed by a final layer with four outputs (bounding box coordinates).
Loss Function: A combination of IoU loss and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to enhance localization accuracy.
Training
Hyperparameters:
IMAGE_SIZE = 224
BATCH_SIZE = 32
EPOCHS = 500
Learning Rate Scheduler: Cyclical learning rate scheduler implemented to adapt learning rate during training.
Callbacks: Early stopping, learning rate reduction, and checkpointing for best weights.
To start training, run:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using Intersection over Union (IoU) and combined loss functions on the validation set.

python
Copy code
# Evaluate the model on the validation set
val_loss, val_iou = model.evaluate(val_dataset)
print(f"Final validation loss: {val_loss}")
print(f"Final validation IoU: {val_iou}")
Visualization
Use the visualize_prediction function to compare predicted bounding boxes with ground truth on sample images:

python
Copy code
for i in range(5):  # Visualize predictions for the first 5 samples
    visualize_prediction(model, df, i, images_dir)
